Here's a suggested structure for breaking it up:

server.py - Main server setup and initialization
FastMCP server configuration
Lifespan context management
Main entry point
tools/claim_analyzer.py - The analyze_claim tool implementation
Main analyze_claim function
Result formatting
tools/perspective_history.py - The get_perspective_history tool implementation
services/search_service.py - Search-related functionality
Query generation functions
Brave Search API integration
services/llm_service.py - LLM-related functionality
Perplexity API integration
Confidence scoring logic
utils/memory_utils.py - Memory-related utilities
Memory storage and retrieval functions
utils/prevalence_utils.py - Prevalence calculation logic
utils/claim_utils.py - Claim type detection and other claim-specific utilities
config.py - Constants, version info, and configuration
Benefits of this approach:

Improved Readability: Each file has a clear, single purpose
Better Maintainability: Easier to update specific components without affecting others
Simplified Testing: Each module can be tested independently
Enhanced Collaboration: Team members can work on different components simultaneously
Reduced Context Size: LLMs can process smaller files more effectively
This modular approach would make the codebase more sustainable as it continues to grow and evolve. It also follows software engineering best practices like the Single Responsibility Principle.
